Constants Module

This module contains application-level constants that define the stock analyst's
behavior. These values are hard-coded because they're part of the application
logic, not environment-specific configuration.

Key Concepts:
- Constants: Values that don't change during execution
- Hard-coding: Putting values directly in code (appropriate for non-secrets)
- Type annotations: UPPER_CASE names indicate these are constants

The difference between constants and environment variables:
- Environment variables (.env): Secrets and deployment-specific values (API keys)
- Constants (this file): Application behavior that's the same everywhere (prompts, stock symbols)
